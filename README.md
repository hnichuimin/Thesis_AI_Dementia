API query workflow
This workflow allows input of two sets of keywords. These keywords are matched against 3 databases: Semantic Scholar, PubMed and Europe PMC. The output is a list of publications related to the keywords matched via Title and Abstract. The worflow provides concatenation and deduplication processes in a stepwise fashion, along with visualisations in the form of projection graphs and wordclouds.
